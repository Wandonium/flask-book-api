## Overview

This is a Python3-Flask server for a book library where we are adding a new â€‹/request endpoint which allows a user to request a book by title. All CRUD endpoints accept and return valid JSON. Sqlite was used as a datastore.

## Prerequisites

- Use of venv for python virtual environment
- Use of pip for installing dependencies

## Library Used

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- Python v3.8.10.

Command to install libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Code locally

- Clone this Repository

  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Wandonium/give-directly.git
  ```

- Go to Project directory

## About Author

Was not done after the 3 hour mark. Would have done the following with some extra time:

- Add test cases for each endpoint using either [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
- Optimized time and space complexity for each endpoint
